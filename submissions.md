## Submission guidelines

We solicit proposals for contributed talks. We recommend preparing proposals of 2 pages, written in English and in either plain text or PDF format. However, we will accept longer proposals or submissions to other conferences, under the understanding that PC members are only expected to read the first two pages of such longer submissions. 

Authors will have the opportunity to choose if they want their papers published in ACM Digital Library (with papers from other EuroSys workshops).

All paper submissions will be handled via Easychair.
