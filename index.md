The 5th Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data will take place on April 23, 2018, in Porto, Portugal, and is co-located with the [EuroSys 2018](http://eurosys2018.org/) conference. It is a successor to previous workhops in this series, [PaPeC 2014](http://eventos.fct.unl.pt/papec/), [PaPoC 2015](http://papoc.di.uminho.pt/), [PaPoC 2016](http://www2.ucsc.edu/papoc-2016/), and [PaPoC 2017](http://software.imdea.org/Conferences/PAPOC17/program.shtml) which brought together researchers and practitioners in the areas of distributed systems, programming languages, databases and concurrent programming.

This workshop aims to investigate the principles and practice of weak consistency models for large-scale, distributed shared data systems. It will bring together theoreticians and practitioners from different horizons: system development, distributed algorithms, concurrency, fault tolerance, databases, language and verification, including both academia and industry. The Call for Papers for PaPoC 2018 is available, please consider submitting your work.
